## SIXTE - Simulation of X-ray Telescopes

SIXTE is a software package for X-ray telescope observation simulations developed 
at the Remeis Observatory (ECAP). It allows to undertake instrument performance 
analyses and to produce simulated event files for mission- and analysis studies.
 
The software strives to find a compromise between exactness of the simulation 
and speed. For many cases, by using calibration files such as the PSF, RMF and 
ARF, efficient simulations are possible at comparably high speed, even though 
they include nonlinear effects such as pileup. Setups for some current and future
missions such as XMM-Newton or Athena are included in the package, others can be 
added by the user with relatively little effort through specifying the main instrument 
characteristics in a flexible, human-readable XML-based format. 


Properties of X-ray sources to be simulated are described in 
a detector-independent format called SIMPUT (SIMulation inPUT). That means the same input can be used for simulating 
observations with all available instruments. The input files can be easily generated from standard data such as XSPEC spectral models or FITS images with tools provided with the SIXTE distribution. The input data scale well from single point sources up to very complicated setups. It lists the basic parameters of the sources such as their flux in a reference band, their positions in a table and can also reference images, spectra and lightcurves. The software implementation of SIMPUT is required for the SIXTE simulator [(https://github.com/thdauser/simput)](https://github.com/thdauser/simput).
